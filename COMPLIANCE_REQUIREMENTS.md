# Healthcare Compliance Requirements for Pharmacy Management System

## Current Implementation Status
The current backup and export system provides basic functionality but requires significant enhancements to meet healthcare regulatory compliance standards (HIPAA, FDA, etc.).

## CRITICAL SECURITY GAPS (Must Address for Production)

### 1. Data Encryption
**Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Requirements**:
- Encrypt all backups at rest using AES-256 encryption
- Implement key management system (KMS) for encryption keys
- Encrypt data in transit for all exports and transfers
- Store encryption keys separately from data

### 2. Access Controls & Authentication
**Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Requirements**:
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for backup operations
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Audit logging for all backup/export access attempts
- Elevated confirmation for destructive operations (delete backups)

### 3. Data Integrity & Consistency
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Requirements**:
- Transactional database snapshots (use pg_dump for PostgreSQL)
- Backup verification with checksums (SHA-256)
- Restore capability with validation testing
- Point-in-time consistency across all tables

### 4. Audit & Compliance Logging
**Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Requirements**:
- Comprehensive audit trail for all data access
- Log backup creation, access, download, and deletion
- Retention policies with automatic cleanup
- Immutable audit logs with digital signatures

### 5. Data Governance & Retention
**Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Requirements**:
- Automated backup scheduling with retention policies
- Offsite backup storage (cloud with encryption)
- Data lifecycle management
- Legal hold capabilities for litigation

## COMPLIANCE FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

### 1. Enhanced Metadata
**Current**: Basic timestamp and record counts
**Required**:
- Application version and schema version
- Data range coverage and completeness verification
- Backup integrity hashes and manifest files
- Regulatory compliance markers

### 2. Export Formats & De-identification
**Current**: CSV only
**Required**:
- Multiple formats: JSON, XLSX, PDF reports
- PHI de-identification for non-clinical exports
- FHIR-compliant exports for interoperability
- Configurable data masking levels

### 3. Restore & Recovery
**Current**: No restore capability
**Required**:
- Full system restore from backups
- Point-in-time recovery options
- Backup validation and testing procedures
- Disaster recovery automation

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next Phase)

1. **Implement Encryption**
   - Add AES-256 encryption for backup files
   - Use environment variables for encryption keys
   - Encrypt sensitive exports before download

2. **Add Access Controls**
   - Implement user authentication system
   - Add role-based permissions for backup operations
   - Require confirmation for sensitive operations

3. **Improve Data Integrity**
   - Switch to transactional database snapshots
   - Add backup verification with checksums
   - Implement basic restore functionality

4. **Enhance Audit Logging**
   - Log all backup and export operations
   - Store logs in tamper-evident format
   - Add user tracking for compliance audits

## REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS

### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- PHI protection requirements
- Access controls and audit trails
- Data encryption standards
- Breach notification procedures

### FDA (Food and Drug Administration)
- 21 CFR Part 11 for electronic records
- Data integrity requirements
- Audit trail standards
- Electronic signature requirements

### State Pharmacy Board Regulations
- Prescription record retention requirements
- Patient privacy protections
- Controlled substance tracking
- Professional practice standards

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risk Issues
1. **Unencrypted PHI Storage**: HIPAA violation risk
2. **No Access Controls**: Unauthorized data access
3. **No Audit Trail**: Compliance verification impossible
4. **No Backup Verification**: Data corruption undetected

### Medium Risk Issues
1. **Limited Export Formats**: Operational inefficiency
2. **No Automated Scheduling**: Manual backup dependency
3. **Local Storage Only**: Single point of failure

### Low Risk Issues
1. **Basic Metadata**: Limited forensic capability
2. **No De-identification**: Privacy enhancement opportunity

## IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

- Audit trail completeness verification

### Compliance Testing
- HIPAA compliance assessment
- FDA validation procedures
- State regulatory compliance check
- Third-party security audit

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The current system should NOT be used with real patient data until security and compliance requirements are implemented. Use only with test data in development environments.
